# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes

The wireframes for IQ KIDS were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). There are frames for a full width display, tablets and a small mobile device.

## Site Structure

The IQ Kids site consists of 3 main pages: [Home page](index.html), [Our Programs](programs.html) and [Sign Up](form.html).There is also a Sign up [confirmation page](formdestination.html). All pages of the website have the same body layout: Header and Footer.

## Design Choices

* ### Typography
  
  The fonts chosen were '_Patua One_' for the headings and menu. '_Maven Pro_' was used for the paragraph content.
  
* ### Colour Scheme

   This color palette is dominated by bright colors. They blend well without being overly flashy. IQ KIDS is a children's establishment, so I wanted to reflect children's bright emotions in colors. This is what IQ KIDS will hopefully be able to convey to the user.

   The following colors were used on the website.

## Browser Compatibility

The IQ KIDS website can work properly on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari. The site has the same functionality, appearance and responsiveness on different devices with different sizes.

## Known Bugs

* ### Resolved

   Bugs were found during the validation and a brief description is provided below:

    * Home page  
    Top-level heading _h1_ was used in all sections and pages, which is not a good practice. Therefore, it was corrected accordingly.
    
    ![W3C Validator test result](assets/readme-images/html-test.png)
  
    * Our Programs page  
    Element _hr_ was nor allowed in lists. It was easily fixed by deleting all _hr_ from _ul_.
    
    ![W3C Validator test result](assets/readme-images/program-test.png)

    * Sign Up Form page
    There was a mistake in a word, so id value for attribites _label_ and _for_ was not identical. It was easily fixed by correct spelling of the word.
  
    ![W3C Validator test result](assets/readme-images/form-test.png)

    * CSS
    There was a margin without unit. It was easily fixed by adding unit after margin number.
  
    ![W3C Validator test result](assets/readme-images/css-test.png)
    
* ### Unresolved

    * CSS
    A media component related error was discovered:
    'Import statements do not load in parallel css (importStatement)'.
    A solution is being pursued.
