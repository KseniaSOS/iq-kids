# User Experience (UX)

## Site Structure

The IQ Kids site consists of 3 main pages: [Home page](index.html), [Our Programs](programs.html) and [Sign Up](form.html).There is also a Sign up [confirmation page](formdestination.html). All pages of the website have the same body layout: Header and Footer.

## Design Choices

* ### Typography
  
  The fonts chosen were '_Patua One_' for the headings and menu. '_Maven Pro_' is for the paragraph content.
  
* ### Colour Scheme

   This color palette is dominated by bright colors. They blend well without being overly flashy. IQ KIDS is a children's establishment, so I wanted to reflect children's bright emotions in colors. This is what IQ KIDS will hopefully be able to convey to the user.

   There are the following colors that have been used on the website.
